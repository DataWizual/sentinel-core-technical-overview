# 🛡️ Auditor Core Baseline V2

**High-Performance Security Orchestration & AI-Assisted Audit Engine**

Auditor Core Baseline V2 is a **proprietary hybrid security engine** designed for deep-dive technical audits. It combines deterministic static analysis (SAST) with an advanced AI-assisted logic verification layer to detect vulnerabilities that standard tools overlook.

## 🚀 Key Capabilities

### 🤖 V2: AI-Assisted Logic Verification
* **Expert Reasoning**: Integrated LLM-driven analysis to detect complex business logic flaws and cross-function vulnerabilities.
* **Context-Aware**: Specifically tuned for distributed systems (Rust, Go, Python) and Web3/Solidity environments.

### 📊 Baseline-Aware Security
* **Delta Auditing**: Separates legacy technical debt from new security regressions.
* **Signal over Noise**: Focuses on high-impact findings, reducing false positives through multi-stage validation.

### 🔒 Enterprise-Grade Privacy
* **Zero Call-Home**: The core engine operates 100% offline. No telemetry or data leakage.
* **Local Execution**: All source code remains within the audited environment.

## 🔎 Security Stack & Orchestration

The engine orchestrates a suite of specialized detectors to provide 360-degree visibility:

| Engine Layer | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Logic & AI** | Proprietary LLM-assisted verification of business logic |
| **SAST (Web3)** | Integrated Slither & Semgrep for deep contract analysis |
| **Infra-as-Code** | Terraform, Kubernetes, and CloudFormation hardening |
| **Secret Detection** | High-entropy scanning for credentials and private keys |
| **SCA Engine** | Automated supply-chain and dependency vulnerability audit |

## 📑 Deliverables

Every audit powered by **Auditor Core V2** results in a comprehensive reporting package:
* **Executive Summary (PDF)**: High-level risk assessment for stakeholders.
* **Technical Dashboard (HTML)**: Deep-dive findings with CWE mapping and remediation code snippets.
* **Automation Data (JSON)**: Machine-readable logs for CI/CD integration.

---

## 🎯 Threat Model Focus

* **Primary Targets**: Supply-chain compromises, unsafe CI/CD workflows, logic-level vulnerabilities, and architectural gaps.
* **Operational Context**: Designed for high-stakes environments where security is non-negotiable.
